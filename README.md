## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Hyperstaker is a decentralized platform which super charges early stage software projects by attaching early contributors to future any project success. It does this by bridging the funding gap between innovation and venture capital by creating utility, value, and demand for Hypercerts. The platform allows users to predict and fund promising public goods projects while securing a vested interest in their success.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

- Project discovery and funding interface
- Enables donations to projects
- Integration with Hypercerts for impact tracking
- Staking on Hypercerts (coming soon)
- Retro-funding support
